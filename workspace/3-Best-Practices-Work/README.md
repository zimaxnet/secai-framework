# Best Practices Assessment Work (Dimension 3)

**Purpose:** Develop compliance mapping matrices, scorecards, and gap analysis tools.

---

## What Goes Here

- Control mapping matrices (frameworks → SecAI scripts)
- Compliance scorecards and dashboards
- Gap analysis and tracking
- Remediation roadmaps
- Framework research and interpretations
- Benchmark data and industry comparisons

---

## Deliverables in Development

### Control Mapping Matrices
- [ ] CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0 → SecAI Mapping
- [ ] NIST Cybersecurity Framework → SecAI Mapping
- [ ] Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark → SecAI Mapping
- [ ] ISO 27001 (relevant controls) → SecAI Mapping
- [ ] HIPAA Controls → SecAI Mapping (if applicable)
- [ ] PCI-DSS Controls → SecAI Mapping (if applicable)

### Assessment Tools
- [ ] Compliance Scorecard (Excel/PowerBI)
- [ ] Gap Tracking Matrix
- [ ] Remediation Roadmap Template
- [ ] Evidence Validation Checklist
- [ ] Framework Comparison Dashboard

### Documentation
- [ ] Control Interpretation Guide
- [ ] Evidence Standards
- [ ] Scoring Methodology
- [ ] Sample Assessments (sanitized)

## Framework Priority

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
1. CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0 - Most commonly required
2. Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark - Native Azure alignment

**Phase 2 (Next Month):**
3. NIST Cybersecurity Framework - Government/enterprise
4. ISO 27001 - International certification

**Phase 3 (As Needed):**
5. Industry-specific (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP, etc.)

---

## Status

**Current Phase:** Matrix Development  
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical gap in framework  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for Phase 1, 4-6 weeks for Phase 2

## Promoting to Production

When ready:
1. Validate mappings against Azure documentation
2. Test with real compliance assessments
3. Refine scoring methodology
4. Move to `implementation/4-Templates/`
5. Update `implementation/1-Documentation/BEST_PRACTICES_ASSESSMENT.md`
