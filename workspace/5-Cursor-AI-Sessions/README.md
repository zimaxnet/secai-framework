## Using Cursor Securely with Azure AI Foundry

### Configuration
- API endpoint: Azure AI Foundry (keeping AI in Azure tenant)
- Model: [Document which models tested]
- Privacy Mode: Enabled
- Data residency: Azure region

### Research Areas

1. **AI-Assisted Security Assessment**
   - Using AI to analyze Azure configurations
   - Pattern recognition in security findings
   - Automated recommendation generation

2. **Prompt Engineering for Security**
   - Prompts for configuration analysis
   - Prompts for risk assessment
   - Prompts for control mapping

3. **Framework Development**
   - Using AI to draft documentation
   - Using AI to generate templates
   - Using AI to validate compliance mappings

4. **Security Guardrails**
   - Testing what AI can/cannot access
   - Preventing credential exposure
   - Data sanitization patterns

## Privacy & Security

### ✅ Safe to Include in Prompts:
- Sanitized examples
- Generic Azure configurations
- Framework questions
- Best practices queries
- Documentation requests

### ❌ Never Include in Prompts:
- Customer names or identifiers
- API keys or credentials
- Real subscription IDs or resource names
- PII or sensitive data
- Unredacted configuration data

## Promoting Findings to Public Docs

When AI research yields valuable patterns:
1. Sanitize and generalize
2. Document in `docs/best-practices/`
3. Add to case studies if applicable
4. Share lessons learned in framework docs
