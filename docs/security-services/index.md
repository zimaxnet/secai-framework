## Service Timing Strategy

### Customer's Multi-Year Approach

```
Year 1-4: Internal + Mandiant Retainer
├── Quarterly: Internal security team pentests
├── Annual: Mandiant targeted assessment
└── On-demand: Mandiant IR retainer (if breach)

Year 5: Comprehensive Red Team
├── Q1-Q2: Ernst & Young red team engagement
├── Q3: Remediation of findings
└── Q4: Re-test and validation

Year 6+: Repeat cycle
├── Continue Mandiant retainer (always active)
├── Rotate red team providers
└── Annual pentesting

Why Year 5 for Major Red Team?
✅ Demonstrates due diligence to auditors
✅ Fresh perspective from external team
✅ Comprehensive multi-vector testing
✅ Executive-level reporting
✅ Regulatory expectation (especially insurance sector)
```

## Retainer vs. On-Demand Services

### Incident Response Retainer Benefits

**Mandiant Retainer Model**:
```yaml
retainer_agreement:
  type: "Incident Response Retainer"
  duration: 12 months
  
  included_services:
    - 24/7 hotline access
    - guaranteed response time: 2 hours
    - dedicated incident response team
    - threat intelligence briefings: quarterly
    - tabletop exercises: annual
    - breach readiness assessment
  
  pricing:
    retainer_fee: $100K-300K/year
    incident_response: $300-500/hour (discounted)
    expenses: reimbursable
  
  value:
    - immediate expert help when needed
    - faster response (vs finding vendor during crisis)
    - relationship with team (context on your environment)
    - lower hourly rates
    - priority scheduling
```

**Cost Comparison**:
```
Scenario: Major data breach

Without Retainer:
├── Find IR firm: 24-48 hours
├── Onboarding: 4-8 hours
├── Hourly rate: $500-800/hour
├── Total hours: 500 hours
├── Total cost: $250K-400K
└── Time to containment: 72+ hours

With Mandiant Retainer:
├── Activate retainer: <2 hours
├── Team familiar with environment
├── Hourly rate: $300-400/hour (discounted)
├── Total hours: 400 hours (more efficient)
├── Total cost: $120K-160K + $150K retainer = $270K-310K
└── Time to containment: 24-48 hours

Benefit:
✅ Faster response = less damage
✅ Lower total cost (if breach occurs)
✅ Better outcome (experienced team)
✅ Compliance benefit (shows preparedness)
