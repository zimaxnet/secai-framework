# DevOps & Testing Tools
{: .no_toc }

Analysis of development, testing, and feature management tools in the Cursor security architecture.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Overview

While security tools protect the infrastructure, DevOps tools enable secure, efficient development workflows. This section covers testing frameworks and feature management platforms used in Cursor environments.

---

## Tool Categories

### Testing Frameworks
- **[Playwright](playwright.md)** - Modern cross-browser testing
- **[Selenium](selenium.md)** - Industry-standard browser automation

### Feature Management
- **[LaunchDarkly](launchdarkly.md)** - Feature flags and progressive delivery

---

## Why These Tools Matter for Security

### Testing Security Controls

**Security Test Automation**:
```
Use Playwright/Selenium to test:
├── Okta SSO flow
├── MFA enforcement
├── RBAC permissions
├── API authentication
├── Session management
├── DLP blocking
└── Incident response workflows

Example: Test that API keys are blocked
```

### Safe Deployment with Feature Flags

**LaunchDarkly for Risk Mitigation**:
```
Deploy new Azure OpenAI integration:
├── Week 1: Enable for 5% of users (canary)
├── Monitor: Cost, errors, performance
├── Week 2: Expand to 25%
├── Week 3: Expand to 100%
└── If issues: Kill switch (instant rollback)

Result: Safe deployment of risky changes
```
