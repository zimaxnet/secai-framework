## Key Features for Cursor Security

### 1. Process Execution Monitoring

**What It Detects**:
- Suspicious child process spawning
- Unusual command-line arguments
- Malicious script execution
- Unauthorized elevation attempts

**Example: Protecting Against Malicious npm Package**:
```
Detection Timeline:
1. Developer runs: npm install malicious-package
2. Package postinstall script executes
3. Script attempts to:
   - Read SSH keys from ~/.ssh
   - Connect to external C2 server
   - Encrypt documents folder
4. CrowdStrike blocks all three actions
5. Alert sent to security team
6. Package quarantined
```

### 2. Network Connection Monitoring

**Capabilities**:
- Track all outbound connections
- Detect C2 (command & control) beacons
- Identify data exfiltration attempts
- Block malicious domains

**For Cursor API Calls**:
```
Allowed Connections:
✅ aoai-cursor-prod.openai.azure.com (Azure OpenAI)
✅ kv-cursor-secrets.vault.azure.net (Key Vault)
✅ github.com (source control)
✅ login.microsoftonline.com (authentication)

Blocked Connections:
❌ suspicious-domain.ru (Known malware C2)
❌ paste.ee/upload (Potential data exfiltration)
❌ cryptominer-pool.com (Cryptojacking)
```

### 3. USB Device Control

**Policy Enforcement**:
- Block unauthorized USB devices
- Allow only company-issued devices
- Monitor file transfers to USB
- Prevent USB-based malware

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
# Falcon USB policy for Cursor developers
usb_policy:
  default_action: BLOCK
  allowed_devices:
    - vendor_id: "0x046D"  # Logitech (keyboards/mice)
    - vendor_id: "0x05AC"  # Apple (peripherals)
  blocked_device_classes:
    - storage  # Block USB drives
    - network  # Block USB network adapters
  exceptions:
    - user_group: "Security-Team"
      allow_storage: true
      require_encryption: true
```

### 4. Identity Protection

**Features**:
- Credential theft prevention
- Hash dumping detection
- Token theft protection
- Kerberos attack detection

**For Azure/Okta Credentials**:
```
Protected Credentials:
├── Azure CLI tokens (~/.azure)
├── Okta session tokens (browser)
├── SSH private keys (~/.ssh)
├── Git credentials
└── AWS credentials (if multi-cloud)

Detection:
- Mimikatz-like behavior blocked
- LSASS memory dump prevented
- Token replay attacks detected
```

## Integration with Cursor Workflow

### Pre-Deployment: Sensor Installation

**Onboarding Checklist**:
```bash
# 1. Install Falcon sensor on all developer workstations
# 2. Verify sensor is running
/Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats

# 3. Configure prevention policies
# 4. Set up integration with Okta for user context
# 5. Enable SIEM integration (EventHub → Cribl)
```

### During Development

**Continuous Monitoring**:
```
Developer Activity:
├── Opens Cursor IDE → Process monitored
├── Installs npm package → Dependencies scanned
├── Connects to Azure OpenAI → Connection logged
├── Commits to GitHub → Credential usage monitored
└── Downloads file → File analyzed for malware
```

**Example Detection**:
```
Alert: Potential Malicious Activity
User: john.developer@company.com
Workstation: LAPTOP-DEV-042
Process: node.exe
Command: node malicious-script.js
Behavior:
  - Attempted to read Azure CLI credentials
  - Made connection to unknown IP (185.x.x.x)
  - Attempted to encrypt files in Documents folder
Action Taken:
  - Process terminated
  - Network connection blocked
  - User notified
  - Security team alerted
  - Incident ticket created (INC-2024-1234)
```

### Incident Response

**CrowdStrike RTR (Real-Time Response)**:
```bash
# Security analyst can remotely investigate
# No VPN or direct access required

# 1. Connect to affected host
> connect LAPTOP-DEV-042

# 2. Run forensics commands
> ps  # List processes
> netstat  # Check connections
> get ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Retrieve for analysis

# 3. Remediate
> kill <pid>  # Stop malicious process
> reg delete <registry-key>  # Remove persistence
> network block 185.x.x.x  # Block C2 server

# 4. Collect evidence
> memdump  # Memory capture for forensics
```

## Best Practices for CrowdStrike with Cursor

### 1. Create Developer-Specific Policies

**Exclusions for Development Tools**:
```yaml
# Falcon policy: Developer Workstations
prevention_policy:
  name: "Cursor-Developer-Policy"
  exclusions:
    processes:
      - path: "/Applications/Cursor.app"
      - path: "*/node_modules/*"
      - path: "*/npm-cache/*"
    directories:
      - "~/workspace/*"  # Monitored but not blocked
      - "~/dev/*"
  monitoring:
    log_all: true  # Still log everything
    block_suspicious: true  # But don't block normal dev activity
```

### 2. Enable SIEM Integration

**Send Detections to Chronicle**:
```bash
# Configure CrowdStrike Event Stream API
curl -X POST "https://api.crowdstrike.com/sensors/entities/datafeed/v2" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FALCON_API_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "appId": "cribl-integration",
    "eventType": "DetectionSummaryEvent",
    "endpoint": "https://eventhub.azure.com/falcon-detections"
  }'

# Cribl routes to Chronicle for correlation
```

### 3. Configure USB Control

**Balance Security & Usability**:
```
Allow: Company-issued USB-C hubs, keyboards, mice
Block: USB storage devices
Require: Manager approval for exceptions
Audit: All USB device connections logged
```

### 4. Set Up Response Playbooks

**Automated Response**:
```python
# Example: Auto-response to credential theft attempt

def handle_credential_theft_alert(alert):
    user_id = alert['user_id']
    hostname = alert['hostname']
    
    # 1. Isolate host from network (via Falcon API)
    falcon.isolate_host(hostname)
    
    # 2. Force Azure/Okta session logout
    okta.revoke_user_sessions(user_id)
    azure.revoke_refresh_tokens(user_id)
    
    # 3. Notify security team
    teams.send_alert(channel='security-incidents', alert=alert)
    
    # 4. Create incident ticket
    jira.create_incident(alert)
    
    # 5. Require password reset
    okta.require_password_reset(user_id)
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### CrowdStrike + Wiz

**Complementary Coverage**:
- **CrowdStrike**: Endpoint/workstation security
- **Wiz**: Cloud infrastructure security

**Shared Intelligence**:
```
Threat Scenario:
1. Wiz detects misconfigured Azure OpenAI (public access)
2. Attacker exploits misconfiguration
3. CrowdStrike detects unusual API activity from developer workstation
4. Correlation in Chronicle: Same attack campaign
5. Unified response: Fix cloud config + isolate endpoint
```

### CrowdStrike + Okta

**Identity Context**:
```
CrowdStrike sends to SIEM:
├── Hostname: LAPTOP-DEV-042
├── Local User: john.developer
├── Process: suspicious-script.exe
└── Okta enrichment:
    ├── Email: john.developer@company.com
    ├── Manager: jane.manager@company.com
    ├── Department: Engineering
    ├── Last Login: 2 hours ago
    └── Risk Score: 85/100 (recent password change)
```

## Why Not Palo Alto Cortex XDR?

As mentioned in the [overview](index.md#palo-alto-cortex-xdr---not-deployed), the customer chose CrowdStrike over Cortex XDR:

**CrowdStrike Advantages**:
1. **Better endpoint protection**: More mature EDR platform
2. **Lighter agent**: Lower performance impact
3. **Cloud-native**: No on-prem infrastructure
4. **Threat intelligence**: Industry-leading intel from CrowdStrike team
5. **Established deployment**: Already in use, proven at scale

**Cortex XDR Would Add**:
- ❌ Duplicate endpoint protection (overlaps CrowdStrike)
- ❌ Additional agent overhead
- ❌ Migration cost and risk
- ❌ Team retraining required
