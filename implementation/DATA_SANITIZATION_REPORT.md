## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Measures Added

### 1. README in Output Folder
Created: `3-Data/Output/README.md`

**Content:**
- Explains what goes in the output folder

- Sanitization guidelines
- Data lifecycle documentation
- Security reminders

### 2. .gitignore Protection
Created: `3-Data/Output/.gitignore`

**Protects Against:**
- Accidental git commits of customer data
- Prevents JSON/CSV files from being tracked
- Blocks all data file types
- Keeps only README and .gitignore

**Rules:**
```gitignore
*.json
*.csv
*.txt
*/
!.gitignore
!README.md
```

### 3. Documentation References
Kept: `BINARY_FILES_NOTE.md`

**Purpose:**
- Guides users on sanitizing binary files (Excel, PowerPoint)
- Example references to NICO/TCS for demonstration
- Intentional - shows what to look for and remove
