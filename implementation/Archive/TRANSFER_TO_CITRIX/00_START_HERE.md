## 🔒 Environment Constraints

### What You Have:
- ✅ Azure Portal (read-only initially)
- ✅ Copilot for Web (enterprise security)
- ✅ VS Code in Citrix VM
- ✅ These reference files

### What You May Not Have Yet:
- ❌ Azure CLI (request from IT)
- ❌ Cloud Shell access
- ❌ Write permissions (portal)

---

## 🚀 First Steps

### Day 1 Tasks (30 min)
1. ✅ Test Azure Portal access
2. ✅ Document what subscriptions you can see
3. ✅ Submit Azure CLI installation request (see template below)
4. ✅ Begin manual resource inventory

### Azure CLI Request Template

```
Subject: Azure CLI Installation Request - Security Architect

Request: Install Azure CLI for security architecture assessment

Business Justification:
- Security assessment requires programmatic access
- Read-only portal limits analysis capability
- CLI enables efficient compliance checking
- Local CLI more secure than Cloud Shell

Security Considerations:
- Azure AD/Entra ID auth with MFA
- Read-only access initially
- All usage audited via Azure AD logs
- Principle of least privilege

Technical Requirements:
- Azure CLI version 2.50.0+
- Authentication: az login --tenant <customer-tenant-id>
- No stored credentials (Azure AD interactive auth)

Timeline: Non-urgent, 1-2 weeks preferred
```

## 📊 What You Can Do Now (No CLI Required)

### Portal-Based Security Assessment
- Document all visible resources
- Review Security Center recommendations
- Check Azure Policy compliance
- Analyze RBAC assignments
- Map network architecture
- Screenshot configurations (no sensitive data!)

### Create These Documents
1. **Resource Inventory** - Manual list from portal
2. **Security Assessment** - Findings and risks
3. **RBAC Matrix** - Who has access to what
4. **Risk Register** - Identified threats
5. **Remediation Roadmap** - Prioritized fixes

## 🤖 Using Copilot Safely in Secure Environment

### ✅ SAFE Queries:
```
"How do I configure Azure Key Vault with RBAC?"
"Show me Azure security best practices for NSGs"
"What are CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark controls?"
"Help me audit RBAC assignments for security issues"
```

### ❌ NEVER Share:
- Customer secrets or credentials
- Subscription IDs or tenant IDs
- Resource names or URLs
- PII or confidential data
- Network configurations

### Use Abstraction:
```
Good: "How do I secure Azure storage accounts?"
Bad:  "How do I secure sa-prod-customer-data-001?"
```
