## 🚀 Transfer Methods

### Method 1: Direct File Upload (If Available)

If your Citrix VM allows file uploads:

1. **Navigate to**: `TRANSFER_TO_CITRIX/` folder
2. **Select all 6 files**
3. **Upload** via Citrix file transfer mechanism
4. **Verify** all files transferred successfully

---

### Method 2: Copy/Paste via Copilot Web

If you need to use Copilot for Web interface:

**For Each File**:

1. **Open file** on your local machine (outside Citrix)
2. **Copy entire contents** (Cmd+A, Cmd+C on Mac / Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C on Windows)
3. **Switch to** Citrix VM
4. **Open VS Code** in Citrix
5. **Create new file** with exact same name
6. **Paste contents** (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)
7. **Save file**
8. **Verify** formatting looks correct

**Recommended Order**:
1. Start with `00_START_HERE.md` (most important)
2. Then `04_COPILOT_SAFE_USAGE.md` (need this before using Copilot)
3. Then remaining files as needed

---

### Method 3: Via Copilot Chat (If File Upload Not Available)

If you can only use Copilot chat interface:

**Option A - Request Copilot to Recreate**:
```
You: "I need to recreate a file called 00_START_HERE.md with the 
following contents: [paste content]"

Then: "Please create this file for me"
```

**Option B - Use Copilot as Intermediary**:
```
You: "I'm going to paste file contents. Please confirm you received 
them and help me create the file."

[Paste contents]

You: "Now create a file called 00_START_HERE.md with exactly these contents"
```

## ✅ Setup in Citrix VM

### Step 1: Create Workspace Folder

In VS Code terminal (Citrix VM):
```bash
# Create secure workspace
mkdir -p ~/secure-workspace/docs

# Navigate to it
cd ~/secure-workspace

# Create docs folder
mkdir -p docs
```

### Step 2: Transfer Files

Use one of the transfer methods above to get all 6 files into:
```
~/secure-workspace/docs/
```

### Step 3: Verify Transfer

```bash
# Check all files are present
ls -lh ~/secure-workspace/docs/

# Should show:
# 00_START_HERE.md
# 01_AZURE_CLI_ESSENTIALS.md
# 02_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT_CHECKLIST.md
# 03_SECURITY_TEMPLATES.md
# 04_COPILOT_SAFE_USAGE.md
# README_TRANSFER_INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Verify file sizes (should be similar)
du -h ~/secure-workspace/docs/*
```

### Step 4: Create Working Folders

```bash
cd ~/secure-workspace

# Create folder structure
mkdir -p documentation/{security-assessments,compliance-reports,architecture-diagrams,risk-register}
mkdir -p scripts/{security-scans,compliance-checks,reporting}
mkdir -p deliverables/{weekly-reports,executive-summaries,technical-docs}

# Verify structure
tree -L 2
```
