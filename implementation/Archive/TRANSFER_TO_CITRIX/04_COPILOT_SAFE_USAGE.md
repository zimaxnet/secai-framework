# ü§ñ Safe Copilot Usage in Secure Environments

**Purpose**: Guidelines for using GitHub Copilot safely in customer environments  
**Critical**: Follow these rules to protect customer data

---

## üîí Core Security Principle

**NEVER share customer-specific data with any AI tool, including Copilot.**

Even with enterprise security controls, use abstraction and generic examples.

## üéØ Use Abstraction Techniques

### Example 1: Key Vault Access

**‚ùå BAD - Customer-Specific**:
```
"How do I access Key Vault kv-prod-acme-secrets-001 with service 
principal sp-prod-app-001? The vault is in subscription 
12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012."
```

**‚úÖ GOOD - Generic**:
```
"How do I configure a service principal to access Azure Key Vault 
using RBAC? Show me the required role assignments and code example."
```

---

### Example 2: Network Security

**‚ùå BAD - Customer-Specific**:
```
"We have NSG allowing 0.0.0.0/0 to 10.50.100.0/24 on port 3389. 
How do I fix this for our production environment?"
```

**‚úÖ GOOD - Generic**:
```
"How do I identify and remediate overly permissive NSG rules that 
allow RDP from any source? Show me Azure CLI commands to audit this."
```

---

### Example 3: RBAC Analysis

**‚ùå BAD - Customer-Specific**:
```
"User john.doe@acmecorp.com has Owner role on subscription 
'Acme-Production'. Should he have this access?"
```

**‚úÖ GOOD - Generic**:
```
"What are best practices for granting Owner role in Azure? 
How do I audit subscription-level Owner assignments for security?"
```

---

### Example 4: Storage Security

**‚ùå BAD - Customer-Specific**:
```
"Storage account sacmeprod001 has public blob access enabled and 
contains customer PII. How do I secure it?"
```

**‚úÖ GOOD - Generic**:
```
"How do I audit Azure storage accounts for public access and disable 
it securely? What's the impact of disabling public blob access?"
```

---

### Example 5: Compliance

**‚ùå BAD - Customer-Specific**:
```
"Acme Corp needs SOC 2 compliance. Here's our current Azure setup: 
[detailed customer environment]. What's missing?"
```

**‚úÖ GOOD - Generic**:
```
"What Azure controls are required for SOC 2 compliance? 
Show me a checklist and Azure Policy examples for SOC 2."
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Sanitization Techniques

### Before Sharing Code/Config with Copilot

**Replace specifics with placeholders**:

**Original (DON'T SHARE)**:
```json
{
  "vaultUri": "https://kv-acme-prod-001.vault.azure.net",
  "tenantId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
  "clientId": "abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ab-cdefghijklmn"
}
```

**Sanitized (OK TO SHARE)**:
```json
{
  "vaultUri": "https://<keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net",
  "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
  "clientId": "<client-id>"
}
```

---

### When Sharing Logs

**Original (DON'T SHARE)**:
```
Error accessing https://sacmeprod001.blob.core.windows.net/customer-data
Failed authentication for user john.doe@acmecorp.com
Source IP: 203.0.113.45
```

**Sanitized (OK TO SHARE)**:
```
Error accessing https://<storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>
Failed authentication for user <username>
Source IP: <ip-address>
```

---

### When Sharing Error Messages

**Original (DON'T SHARE)**:
```
ResourceNotFound: The Resource 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/kv-acme-prod-001' 
under resource group 'rg-acme-production' was not found.
```

**Sanitized (OK TO SHARE)**:
```
ResourceNotFound: The Resource 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>' 
under resource group '<resource-group>' was not found.

[Then ask]: "How do I troubleshoot Azure Key Vault not found errors?"
```

## üéì Copilot Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Script Development

**Task**: Create script to audit storage accounts

**‚úÖ Safe Approach**:
1. Ask: "Write Azure CLI script to check if storage accounts have public blob access enabled"
2. Get generic script from Copilot
3. Test locally with YOUR customer environment
4. Customize as needed WITHOUT asking Copilot about specifics

**‚ùå Unsafe Approach**:
1. "Check if sacmeprod001, sacmeprod002, sacmetest001 have public access"

---

### Scenario 2: Troubleshooting

**Task**: Fix Key Vault access issue

**‚úÖ Safe Approach**:
1. Identify the error type (authentication, authorization, network)
2. Ask: "How do I troubleshoot Azure Key Vault authentication errors?"
3. Ask: "What RBAC roles are needed for Key Vault secret access?"
4. Apply solutions to YOUR environment

**‚ùå Unsafe Approach**:
1. Paste full error with vault name, user email, subscription ID

---

### Scenario 3: Architecture Review

**Task**: Review network security architecture

**‚úÖ Safe Approach**:
1. Draw generic diagram WITHOUT customer names
2. Ask: "Review this Azure network architecture for security best practices"
3. Share ONLY the generic diagram structure
4. Apply recommendations to customer environment

**‚ùå Unsafe Approach**:
1. Share detailed network diagram with customer IP ranges, resource names, etc.

---

### Scenario 4: Compliance Checking

**Task**: Verify CIS Azure Foundations compliance

**‚úÖ Safe Approach**:
1. Ask: "What are CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark controls for network security?"
2. Ask: "Show me Azure Policy examples for CIS compliance"
3. Run checks in YOUR environment
4. Document findings WITHOUT sharing customer-specific data

**‚ùå Unsafe Approach**:
1. "Here's our environment: [detailed customer setup]. What CIS controls are we missing?"

## üìã Copilot Usage Checklist

Before asking Copilot anything:

- [ ] Does my question contain customer names?
- [ ] Does it include subscription/tenant IDs?
- [ ] Does it include resource names?
- [ ] Does it include IP addresses or URLs?
- [ ] Does it include credentials or secrets?
- [ ] Does it include PII or sensitive data?
- [ ] Could someone identify the customer from my question?

**If ANY answer is YES, REWRITE using abstraction before asking.**

---

## üö® What To Do If You Accidentally Share Sensitive Data

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Stop the session** - Close Copilot chat immediately
2. **Document the incident** - What was shared, when, which tool
3. **Notify security team** - Follow incident response procedure
4. **Change credentials** - If any credentials were shared
5. **Fill out incident report** - Use incident template

**Prevention**:
- Always pause before hitting Enter
- Review your prompt before submitting
- When in doubt, use more abstraction
- Better to ask generic question than risk exposure

---

## ‚úÖ Enterprise Copilot Features (Your Protection)

Your enterprise Copilot has these protections:

**‚úÖ What's Protected**:
- Code you write is NOT used for training
- Prompts are logged for audit (your security team can review)
- Data retention policies in place
- Compliance with customer requirements
- Enterprise-grade security

**‚ö†Ô∏è But YOU Still Must**:
- Never share customer secrets
- Use abstraction for customer-specific scenarios
- Follow security policies
- Document your usage if required
- Report any concerns

---

## üí° Pro Tips for Secure Copilot Usage

### 1. Ask Generic, Apply Specific
```
Ask Copilot: "How do I X?" (generic)
Apply answer to: Your customer environment (specific)
```

### 2. Use Hypotheticals
```
"In a hypothetical Azure environment with [generic setup], 
how would I [do security task]?"
```

### 3. Break Down Questions
```
Instead of: "Fix all our security issues: [detailed environment]"
Ask: "What are common Azure NSG security issues?"
Then: "How do I remediate overly permissive NSG rules?"
Then: "Show me script to audit NSG rules"
```

### 4. Use Example.com Pattern
```
Instead of: acmecorp.onmicrosoft.com
Use: example.onmicrosoft.com or <tenant>.onmicrosoft.com
```

### 5. Use RFC 5737 IPs for Examples
```
Instead of: Real customer IPs
Use: 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24 (documentation IPs)
```

---

## üéØ Summary: The Golden Rule

**"Would I be comfortable with this prompt being read by:**
- **My customer's CISO?**
- **A compliance auditor?**
- **Someone from a competing organization?"**

**If NO to any of these, use more abstraction!**

---

## üìö Quick Reference Card

**ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF**:
1. Is this customer-specific? ‚Üí Use abstraction
2. Does this have identifiers? ‚Üí Remove them
3. Does this have secrets? ‚Üí NEVER share
4. Could this identify the customer? ‚Üí Sanitize
5. Am I unsure? ‚Üí Err on side of caution

**SAFE PATTERN**:
- Generic question ‚Üí Copilot helps ‚Üí Apply to customer

**UNSAFE PATTERN**:
- Customer details ‚Üí Copilot analyzes ‚Üí VIOLATION

---

**Remember**: Copilot is a powerful tool, but YOU are responsible for protecting customer data. When in doubt, ask generically!
