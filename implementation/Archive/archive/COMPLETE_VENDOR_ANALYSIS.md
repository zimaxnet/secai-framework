## Key Research Insights

### 1. Real-World Security Stack

**Production-Validated Architecture**:
```
Complete Security Stack (Insurance Company):

Identity Layer:
└── Okta ($750/month) → Azure Entra ID (federation)

Endpoint Security:
└── CrowdStrike Falcon ($750/month)

Cloud Security:
├── Wiz CNAPP ($555/month)
└── Azure Defender EASM ($8K/month)

Network Security:
├── Prisma Access SASE ($1K/month)
└── Azure Firewall ($10K/month, 5 instances)

Application Security:
├── Veracode ($22K/month)
└── Purview DLP (E5 licensing)

Attack Surface:
├── UpGuard ($3.75K/month)
└── Azure EASM ($8K/month)

Vulnerability Management:
└── Qualys VMDR ($21.5K/month)

Log Management:
├── Azure EventHub → Cribl Stream ($6.7K/month)
├── Chronicle SIEM ($8.3K/month)
└── Splunk (PreProd/Prod) ($157K/month)

DevOps Tools:
├── Playwright (open source, $0)
├── Selenium (open source, $0)
└── LaunchDarkly ($1K/month)

Professional Services (Annual):
├── Mandiant Retainer ($250K/year)
├── Black Hills Pentesting ($120K/year)
└── EY Red Team (Year 5: $400K)

TOTAL MONTHLY: ~$243K/month
TOTAL ANNUAL: ~$2.9M/year + $250K services = $3.15M/year
```

### 2. Why Cortex XDR Was Not Deployed

**Comprehensive Analysis Documented**:
```
Cortex XDR Overlaps:
├── Endpoint Security → CrowdStrike Falcon (better)
├── Cloud Security → Wiz (better for cloud-native)
├── SIEM Features → Chronicle + Splunk (established)
├── Network Visibility → Prisma Access + Azure Firewall (sufficient)
└── Cost: $250K-500K/year additional (not justified)

Decision: Use Palo Alto where they excel (Prisma Access for SASE)
          Don't use where others excel (CrowdStrike for endpoints)

Savings: $400K/year by avoiding Cortex XDR
```

### 3. Multi-Environment Logging Strategy

**Cost Optimization via Cribl**:
```
Without Cribl:
All logs → Splunk: $7.2M/year

With Cribl + Chronicle:
Dev/Test/UAT → Chronicle: $0 incremental (flat rate)
PreProd/Prod → Chronicle + Splunk: $1.9M/year
Cribl License: $80K/year
Total: $2M/year

Savings: $5.2M/year (72% reduction!)
```
