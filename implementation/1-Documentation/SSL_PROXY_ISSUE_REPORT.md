# Azure Assessment Kit - SSL Proxy Issue Report

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue Type:** Technical Limitation  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Workaround Implemented, Long-term Fix Required

---

## Executive Summary

During the Azure security assessment, we encountered SSL certificate verification failures when querying Microsoft Graph API for Azure Active Directory data. This is caused by a corporate SSL-inspecting proxy that intercepts HTTPS traffic with a self-signed certificate that Azure CLI does not trust.

**Immediate Action Taken:** Implemented a workaround script that bypasses Azure AD queries while still collecting critical RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) data.

**Long-term Action Required:** Configure Azure CLI to trust the corporate proxy certificate to enable complete Azure AD data collection in future assessments.

---

## Technical Issue Details

### What Happened

When executing script `04_identity_and_privileged.ps1`, the following errors occurred:

```
ERROR: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='graph.microsoft.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded
Certificate verification failed: Missing Authority Key Identifier
```

### Root Cause

1. **Corporate Proxy Configuration:**
   - Network traffic to `graph.microsoft.com` is intercepted by a corporate SSL-inspecting proxy
   - The proxy re-encrypts traffic using a corporate self-signed certificate
   - This is a common security practice in enterprise environments

2. **Azure CLI Certificate Validation:**
   - Azure CLI validates SSL certificates against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs)
   - The corporate proxy certificate is not in Azure CLI's trusted CA bundle
   - Certificate lacks "Authority Key Identifier" extension required for validation

3. **Impact on Graph API Calls:**
   - Microsoft Graph API is used to query Azure Active Directory data
   - All Graph API endpoints (`graph.microsoft.com`) are affected
   - Azure Resource Manager API (`management.azure.com`) works fine

### Affected Data Collection

❌ **Cannot Collect (without workaround):**
- Azure AD Application Registrations (tenant-wide)
- Azure AD Service Principals (tenant-wide)
- Principal name resolution in RBAC assignments

✅ **Can Still Collect:**
- RBAC role assignments (with principal IDs/GUIDs)
- All Azure Resource Manager data (policies, resources, networks, etc.)
- All other assessment scripts (scripts 05-09)

---

## Workaround Implemented

### Solution: Modified Assessment Script

Created: `04_identity_and_privileged_NO_AD.ps1`

**What It Does:**
- ✅ Skips Azure AD application and service principal queries
- ✅ Collects RBAC role assignments for all 34 subscriptions
- ✅ Creates placeholder files for missing Azure AD data
- ✅ Includes `--include-inherited` flag for comprehensive RBAC coverage
- ✅ Completes successfully without SSL errors

**Limitations:**
- Azure AD applications list will be empty (`[]`)
- Service principals list will be empty (`[]`)
- RBAC role assignments will show principal IDs as GUIDs instead of friendly names
- Cannot correlate RBAC assignments to specific applications or service principals

### Data Quality Impact

**High Impact (RBAC Data):** ✅ **COLLECTED**
- Role assignments are the most critical identity data
- Shows who has access to what resources
- Includes Owner, Contributor, Reader, and custom roles
- Essential for security and compliance assessments

**Medium Impact (Azure AD Data):** ⚠️ **MISSING**
- Application registrations show what apps have access
- Service principals show identity of non-human accounts
- Useful for complete identity landscape view
- Can be collected separately via Azure Portal or Graph API later

**Low Impact (Name Resolution):** ⚠️ **DEGRADED**
- RBAC shows GUIDs instead of user/group/app names
- Can be resolved manually or with separate lookup
- Does not prevent security analysis

## Assessment Continuity

### Current Assessment Status

✅ **Completed Successfully:**
1. Scope Discovery (34 subscriptions)
2. Resource Inventory (856 RGs, 5,088 resources)
3. Policy & Defender Assessment (436 policy assignments)
4. Identity & RBAC (workaround script) ← **CURRENT**

⏭️ **Ready to Continue:**
5. Network Security Assessment
6. Data Protection Assessment
7. Logging & Threat Detection
8. Backup & Recovery
9. Security Posture & Vulnerability

**Impact on Remaining Scripts:** ✅ **NONE**

Scripts 05-09 do not use Microsoft Graph API and will not be affected by the SSL proxy issue. They can proceed normally.

## Long-term Resolution Required

### Recommended Solution: Configure Azure CLI Certificate Trust

**Goal:** Enable Azure CLI to trust the corporate SSL-inspecting proxy certificate

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Obtain Corporate Proxy Certificate (IT Department)

**Request from IT Security/Network Team:**
```
Subject: Corporate SSL Proxy Certificate - Azure CLI Configuration

We need the SSL certificate used by the corporate proxy for HTTPS inspection 
to configure Azure CLI for cloud security assessments.

Required: Root and intermediate certificates in PEM or CER format.
Purpose: Azure CLI validation of graph.microsoft.com connections.
```

**Expected Response:**
- Root CA certificate file (e.g., `corporate-root-ca.cer`)
- Intermediate certificate(s) if applicable
- Installation instructions

#### Step 2: Configure Azure CLI (After Certificate Received)

**Option A: System-wide Certificate Installation (Recommended)**

Windows:
```powershell
# Import certificate to Windows Trusted Root CA store (requires admin)
certutil -addstore "Root" "C:\path\to\corporate-root-ca.cer"

# Restart Azure CLI session to pick up new trust
```

**Option B: Azure CLI Specific Configuration**

```powershell
# Set environment variable pointing to CA bundle
$env:REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE = "C:\path\to\corporate-ca-bundle.pem"

# Or set in Azure CLI config
az configure --defaults ca_bundle="C:\path\to\corporate-ca-bundle.pem"
```

**Option C: Python Certifi Bundle (if using Python)**

```powershell
# Locate Python certifi bundle
python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"

# Append corporate cert to the bundle
type corporate-root-ca.cer >> [path-from-above]\cacert.pem
```

#### Step 3: Validation

```powershell
# Test Graph API access
az rest --method GET --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications?`$top=1"

# If successful, run diagnostics
.\00_diagnostics.ps1

# Then re-run full identity script
.\04_identity_and_privileged.ps1
```

## Business Justification for Long-term Fix

### Why This Matters

#### 1. **Complete Identity Visibility**

**Without Fix:**
- ❌ Cannot see which applications have Azure access
- ❌ Cannot identify orphaned service principals
- ❌ Cannot map application owners or expiration dates
- ❌ Limited ability to detect overprivileged applications

**With Fix:**
- ✅ Full inventory of Azure AD applications
- ✅ Complete service principal catalog
- ✅ Application credential expiration tracking
- ✅ Enhanced security posture visibility

#### 2. **Compliance and Audit Requirements**

Many compliance frameworks require:
- Complete inventory of identities with cloud access
- Regular review of application permissions
- Service principal lifecycle management
- Audit trail of who has access to what

**Examples:**
- **SOC 2:** Requires documented access controls and regular review
- **ISO 27001:** Identity and access management controls
- **NIST CSF:** Identity management and access control (PR.AC)
- **CIS Azure Benchmark:** Identity and access management controls

#### 3. **Security Risk Management**

**Risks of Incomplete Data:**
- **Orphaned Applications:** Cannot identify apps no longer in use but still have access
- **Credential Expiration:** Cannot track app credential expiration dates
- **Overprivileged Apps:** Limited visibility into what permissions apps have
- **Shadow IT:** Cannot detect unauthorized applications accessing Azure

**Value of Complete Data:**
- Identify applications with excessive permissions
- Track service principal credential lifecycle
- Detect applications that haven't been used recently
- Map application owners for accountability

#### 4. **Operational Efficiency**

**Current Workaround:**
- ⏱️ Requires manual Azure Portal queries for AD data
- 📊 Separate data sources need manual correlation
- 🔄 Not repeatable or automatable
- 📋 More time-consuming for future assessments

**With Proper Configuration:**
- ⚡ Automated, consistent data collection
- 📦 Single source of truth for all Azure data
- 🔁 Repeatable monthly/quarterly assessments
- 💰 Reduced manual effort and cost

## Alternative Workarounds (If Long-term Fix Not Possible)

If configuring certificate trust is not feasible, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Temporary SSL Verification Bypass

```powershell
# For single session only
$env:AZURE_CLI_DISABLE_CONNECTION_VERIFICATION = "1"
.\04_identity_and_privileged.ps1
```

**Pros:** 
- ✅ Collects complete data
- ✅ No IT department involvement needed
- ✅ Quick to implement

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Security risk (disables SSL validation)
- ⚠️ Only recommended in trusted corporate networks
- ⚠️ Not a best practice
- ⚠️ May violate security policies

### Option 2: Azure Portal Export

Manually export Azure AD data from Azure Portal:
1. Navigate to Azure AD > App registrations > Download
2. Navigate to Azure AD > Enterprise applications > Download
3. Merge with RBAC data collected via script

**Pros:**
- ✅ No certificate configuration needed
- ✅ No SSL bypass required
- ✅ Uses trusted portal interface

**Cons:**
- ⏱️ Time-consuming (manual process)
- 🔄 Not repeatable/automatable
- 📊 Requires manual data merge
- 💰 Higher operational cost

### Option 3: Azure Resource Graph Query

Use Resource Graph for some identity data:
```powershell
az graph query -q "policyresources | where type == 'microsoft.authorization/roleassignments'"
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No Graph API dependency
- ✅ Automated collection possible

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Limited data (no app details)
- ⚠️ Different data format
- ⚠️ Still missing service principal information
