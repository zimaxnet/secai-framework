## 🔐 Security First - Critical Reminders

### Using Enterprise Copilot Safely

**✅ DO**:
- Ask about Azure security patterns
- Request architecture guidance
- Generate documentation templates
- Query best practices
- Review code for security issues

**❌ NEVER**:
- Share customer secrets or credentials
- Include subscription IDs in prompts
- Paste PII or confidential data
- Expose proprietary business logic
- Share network architecture specifics

**Use abstraction**:
```
✅ Good: "How do I configure Azure Key Vault with RBAC?"
❌ Bad:  "How do I access kv-prod-customer-001?"
```

### Your Role: Security Architect

You are responsible for:
- ✅ Security architecture and governance
- ✅ Risk identification and management
- ✅ Compliance validation
- ✅ Access control review
- ✅ Incident response planning

Everything through the lens of **security first**.

---

## 📊 What You Can Do NOW (Before CLI)

### Portal-Based Security Assessment

**Resource Inventory**:
- Document all resources manually
- Note resource groups and organization
- Identify naming conventions
- Map dependencies

**Security Review**:
- Review Security Center recommendations
- Check Azure Policy compliance
- Identify publicly exposed resources
- Review NSG rules

**Access Control**:
- Document RBAC assignments
- Identify privileged accounts
- Review service principals
- Map access patterns

**Compliance**:
- Check compliance dashboard
- Identify control gaps
- Document requirements
- Plan remediations

### Deliverables (Week 1)

Create these documents:
1. **Resource Inventory** - What exists?
2. **Security Assessment** - What's the risk?
3. **RBAC Matrix** - Who has access?
4. **Risk Register** - What are the threats?
5. **Remediation Roadmap** - What to fix first?

**All possible with read-only portal access!**

## 🚀 What You'll Do LATER (With CLI)

### When Azure CLI Is Granted

1. **Automated Security Scans**
   ```bash
   az security assessment list
   az role assignment list --all
   az policy state list
   ```

2. **Compliance Automation**
   ```bash
   # Run regular compliance checks
   # Generate automated reports
   # Script security validations
   ```

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Weekly security reports
   # Monthly compliance reviews
   # Quarterly RBAC audits
   ```
