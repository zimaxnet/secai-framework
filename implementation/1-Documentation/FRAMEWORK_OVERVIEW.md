# SecAI Framework Overview

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive Azure Security Assessment Framework

---

## Executive Summary

The SecAI Framework is a **three-dimensional security assessment methodology** designed specifically for enterprise Azure environments undergoing transformation from Cloud Service Provider (CSP) management to Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) with Azure Landing Zones.

Unlike traditional assessments that focus solely on technical configurations, the SecAI Framework evaluates:

1. **Configuration** - What is deployed and how it's configured
2. **Process** - How operations are managed and governed
3. **Best Practices** - Alignment with industry standards and frameworks

---

## The Challenge

### CSP to MCA Migration Scenario

**Current State (CSP):**
- Subscriptions in tenant root management group
- Minimal Azure Policy assignments
- CSP manages resources
- Limited governance and standardization
- Customer has limited visibility

**Target State (MCA):**
- Azure Landing Zones architecture
- Comprehensive policy framework (~1,000 Defender for Cloud policies)
- Customer-managed resources
- Full governance and compliance
- Complete visibility and control

**The Gap:**
Between current CSP state and target MCA state lies hundreds of configuration changes, process improvements, and alignment activities. The SecAI Framework systematically identifies and documents these gaps.
