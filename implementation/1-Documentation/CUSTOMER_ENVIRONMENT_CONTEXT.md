# üè¢ Customer Development Environment - Context & Constraints

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Role**: Security Architect  
**Environment Type**: Constrained Enterprise Development

---

## üéØ Mission Context

You are working as a **Security Architect** in a customer's development environment with **strict security controls** and **limited access**. Your mission is to:

1. Establish secure development practices within constraints
2. Assess and improve security architecture
3. Work effectively with minimal tooling
4. Maintain enterprise security standards
5. Eventually enable Azure CLI and other tools

---

## üîí Current Environment State

### What You Have

**Access Level**:
- ‚úÖ **Azure Portal**: Read-only access to subscriptions
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Copilot**: Web-based access with enterprise security enabled
- ‚úÖ **Local Workstation**: Standard development machine
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: SecAI Framework reference materials (this workspace)

**Security Posture**:
- ‚úÖ Enterprise security controls active
- ‚úÖ Data sovereignty respected
- ‚úÖ Compliance frameworks enforced
- ‚úÖ Audit logging in place

### What You Don't Have (Yet)

**Tooling Gaps**:
- ‚ùå **Azure CLI**: Not installed/provisioned
- ‚ùå **Cloud Shell**: Not available in this environment
- ‚ùå **Write Access**: Portal is read-only currently
- ‚ùå **PowerShell Modules**: May need provisioning

**Next Steps**:
- Request Azure CLI through IT
- Document requirements for additional tools
- Work within current constraints while provisioning is in progress

---

## üöß Working with Constraints

### Read-Only Portal Access

**What You CAN Do**:
```markdown
‚úÖ Review existing resources and configurations
‚úÖ Document current architecture
‚úÖ Identify security gaps
‚úÖ Screenshot configurations (without sensitive data)
‚úÖ Map resource relationships
‚úÖ Review RBAC assignments
‚úÖ Analyze network topology
‚úÖ Identify compliance issues
```

**Security Architecture Tasks Possible Now**:
1. **Resource Inventory**
   - Document all resources in subscriptions
   - Note resource groups and organization
   - Identify naming conventions
   - Map dependencies

2. **Security Assessment**
   - Review Security Center recommendations
   - Check Azure Policy compliance
   - Identify publicly exposed resources
   - Review NSG rules and firewall configs

3. **Access Control Analysis**
   - Document RBAC assignments
   - Identify privileged accounts
   - Review service principals
   - Map access patterns

4. **Compliance Review**
   - Check regulatory compliance dashboard
   - Identify control gaps
   - Document framework requirements
   - Plan remediation priorities

### No Cloud Shell Workarounds

**Why No Cloud Shell?**
- Read-only subscription access doesn't grant Cloud Shell storage
- Cloud Shell may be disabled by customer policy
- Alternative approaches needed

**Alternatives** (Implement as tools become available):

1. **Local Azure CLI** (Preferred)
   ```bash
   # Once provisioned, run locally
   # Full control, scriptable, version-controlled
   # Better for enterprise security (your machine, your controls)
   ```

2. **Local PowerShell**
   ```powershell
   # Az PowerShell modules
   # Same capabilities as Azure CLI
   # May be easier to provision in Windows environments
   ```

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   ```bash
   # When write access granted:
   # Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates
   # Version controlled, peer reviewed
   # Better for enterprise governance
   ```

## ü§ñ Enterprise Copilot Usage

### Your Copilot Access

**Type**: Web-based GitHub Copilot with enterprise security
**Status**: ‚úÖ Available and configured
**Security**: Enterprise controls enforced

### Enterprise Security Controls

**What Enterprise Copilot Provides**:
- ‚úÖ No data training on your code
- ‚úÖ Audit logging of usage
- ‚úÖ Policy enforcement
- ‚úÖ Data retention controls
- ‚úÖ Compliance with customer requirements

**Your Responsibilities**:
- ‚ùå Never share customer secrets or credentials
- ‚ùå No subscription IDs or resource identifiers
- ‚ùå No PII or confidential customer data
- ‚ùå No proprietary business logic details
- ‚úÖ Use abstraction and generic examples
- ‚úÖ Ask about patterns and best practices
- ‚úÖ Request security guidance
- ‚úÖ Generate documentation templates

### Safe Copilot Queries for Security Architect

**Architecture & Design**:
```text
‚úÖ "What are Azure security best practices for multi-tier applications?"
‚úÖ "Show me a zero-trust network architecture pattern"
‚úÖ "How should I implement least privilege RBAC?"
‚úÖ "What are common Key Vault access patterns?"
```

**Security Analysis**:
```text
‚úÖ "How do I audit NSG rules for security issues?"
‚úÖ "What are indicators of overprivileged service principals?"
‚úÖ "Show me a security assessment checklist"
‚úÖ "What should I look for in Azure Security Center?"
```

**Compliance & Governance**:
```text
‚úÖ "Map CIS Azure Foundations controls to Azure resources"
‚úÖ "What are NIST 800-53 requirements for cloud logging?"
‚úÖ "Show me ISO 27001 Azure Policy examples"
‚úÖ "How do I document compliance evidence?"
```

**Avoid Specifics**:
```text
‚ùå "How do I access subscription 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012?"
‚ùå "Here's our Key Vault URL: https://customer-kv-prod.vault.azure.net"
‚ùå "Our admin account is admin@customer.com, how do I..."
‚ùå "We have 500TB of PII in storage account X, how to secure?"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Azure CLI Provisioning Strategy

### Request Template

**To**: Customer IT / Security Team  
**Subject**: Azure CLI Installation Request - Security Architect

```markdown
Request: Install Azure CLI for Security Architecture Work

Business Justification:
- Security architecture assessment requires programmatic access
- Read-only portal access limits security analysis capability
- Azure CLI enables efficient resource auditing and compliance checking
- Local CLI provides better security than Cloud Shell (no cloud storage required)

Security Considerations:
- Azure CLI will be configured for customer tenant only
- Authentication via Azure AD/Entra ID with MFA
- All CLI usage will be audited via Azure AD logs
- CLI will be used with read-only access initially
- Follows principle of least privilege

Technical Requirements:
- Azure CLI version 2.50.0 or later
- Windows/macOS/Linux (specify your OS)
- Will authenticate via: az login --tenant <customer-tenant-id>
- No stored credentials, will use Azure AD interactive auth

Benefits:
- Faster security assessments
- Scriptable compliance checks
- Better documentation of current state
- More efficient RBAC analysis
- Improved security posture visibility

Timeline: Non-urgent, within 1-2 weeks preferred

Thank you,
[Your Name]
Security Architect
```

### What to Expect

**Approval Process**:
1. Security team review (1-3 days)
2. IT approval (1-3 days)
3. Installation/provisioning (1-2 days)
4. Configuration and testing (1 day)

**Likely Questions You'll Receive**:
- Why do you need CLI vs portal?
- What permissions do you require?
- How will credentials be managed?
- What audit logging is needed?

**Prepare Answers**:
- CLI enables automation and efficiency
- Same read-only access as current portal access
- Azure AD auth with MFA, no stored creds
- All actions logged to Azure AD audit logs
