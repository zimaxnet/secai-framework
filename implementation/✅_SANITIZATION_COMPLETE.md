*/

```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Current State (Verified Clean)

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Data Output Folder** | 🟢 Clean | Only README.md and .gitignore |
| **Old Output Folder** | 🟢 Clean | Empty |
| **Scripts** | 🟢 Clean | No customer references |
| **Documentation** | 🟢 Clean | Generic examples only |
| **Templates** | 🟢 Clean | Template files only |
| **Reports** | 🟢 Clean | Generic samples |
| **Archive** | 🟢 Clean | Historical materials only |

### Remaining References (Intentional)

**Only 2 files mention NICO/TCS:**
1. `BINARY_FILES_NOTE.md` - Sanitization guide (shows what to remove from binary files)
2. `DATA_SANITIZATION_REPORT.md` - Documents what was removed

**These are appropriate** - they're instructional documents about sanitization, not actual customer data.

---

## 📋 Going Forward

### Before Each Assessment
- ✅ Verify Output folder is empty
- ✅ Confirm .gitignore is in place
- ✅ Framework is clean and portable

### During Assessment
- ⚠️ Output folder will fill with 800+ customer files
- ⚠️ Keep data in secure customer environment
- ⚠️ Do not commit customer data to git

### After Assessment
- 🔒 Archive all data to secure location
- 🗑️ Delete all files from Output folder
- ✅ Confirm framework is clean again

---

## 🚨 Important Reminders

### Never Commit Customer Data
The `.gitignore` in `3-Data/Output/` will prevent accidental commits, but always verify before pushing to git.

### Keep Customer Data Secure
- Customer data stays in customer SharePoint/OneDrive
- Never include in presentations
- Never share publicly
- Always use generic examples in documentation

### Framework Should Be Portable
The SecAI Framework should work in any customer environment without modification. No customer-specific references should exist in the framework itself.
