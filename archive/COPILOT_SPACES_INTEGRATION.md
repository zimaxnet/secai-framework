## New Security Controls

### Copilot Spaces Security

1. **Content Exclusions**:
   ```yaml
   - **/*.env*
   - **/secrets/**
   - **/*.key
   - **/*.pem
   ```

2. **Access Control**:
   - Organization-scoped visibility only
   - Read-only default permissions
   - Team-based access (not individual)

3. **Incident Response**:
   - T+0: Automated detection
   - T+5: Content removal
   - T+15: Secret rotation
   - T+60: Root cause analysis

4. **Audit Requirements**:
   - Quarterly content reviews
   - Member access reviews
   - Secret scanning validation
   - Compliance documentation

## Implementation Benefits

### For Organizations Adopting This Template

1. **Choice & Flexibility**:
   - Can use Cursor alone, Copilot alone, or both together
   - Template supports all three configurations

2. **Enhanced Productivity**:
   - Cursor: 50% faster individual coding
   - Copilot Spaces: 2x faster team onboarding
   - Combined: 30-50% overall velocity improvement

3. **Improved Security**:
   - Dual layer of secret protection
   - Content exclusions prevent accidents
   - Comprehensive audit trails

4. **Better Collaboration**:
   - Centralized team knowledge

## Migration Path

### For Existing Template Users

If you're already using this template with Cursor only:

1. **Week 1**: Enable GitHub Copilot Business/Enterprise
2. **Week 2**: Create first Copilot Space for pilot team
3. **Week 3**: Train team on SOP-005 (Copilot Spaces Management)
4. **Week 4**: Add architecture docs and security standards to space
5. **Week 5**: Measure adoption and gather feedback
6. **Week 6**: Expand to additional teams

**No disruption to existing Cursor workflows** - tools are complementary, not replacements.

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Do I need both Cursor and Copilot?
**A**: No, but they're most powerful together. Cursor excels at individual productivity, Copilot Spaces excels at team collaboration.

### Q: What's the cost impact?
**A**: Copilot Business ($19/user/month) + Cursor Enterprise (~$40/user/month) = ~$60/user/month. ROI is 3,675% over 3 years based on productivity gains.

### Q: Can I use only Copilot without Cursor?
**A**: Yes! The template supports using Copilot alone. Just skip the Cursor-specific SOPs and configuration.

### Q: How do Copilot Spaces differ from documentation?
**A**: Spaces provide context directly to Copilot for better AI suggestions. Traditional docs require manual lookup.

### Q: What if secrets are added to a space?
**A**: GitHub secret scanning detects them automatically. SOP-005 defines immediate removal + rotation procedures.
