Title: [Show r/netsec] SecAI Framework - Enterprise Security for AI Development

I spent months researching secure Cursor IDE deployments for an insurance company and published everything as "SecAI Framework."

• Cost optimization (Cribl saves $5.2M/year vs Splunk-only)
• Why Cortex XDR wasn't deployed despite using Prisma Access
• Multi-environment logging strategy (Dev→Prod via EventHub→Cribl→SIEM)
• Professional services strategy (Mandiant retainer, EY red team)

100% of research under CC BY 4.0. 36 pages of documentation, 200+ code examples.
